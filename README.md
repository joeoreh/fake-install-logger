# fake-install-logger

A harmless **fake installer** that prints **realistic apt-like logs** for ~10 minutes  
(1 line/second, with % progress). Great for demos, screenshots, and terminal recordings.

## Quick Start (2â€“3 commands)

**Install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_GH_USER/fake-install-logger/main/install.sh | bash
